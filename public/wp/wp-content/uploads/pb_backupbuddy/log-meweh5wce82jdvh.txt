[Feb 2, 2017 15:36:03 -6-error] [] Error #9038: Loopback test error: `cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 8000 milliseconds with 1 bytes received`. URL: `http://starlearningsystems.com/wp/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`. If you need to contact your web host, tell them that when PHP tries to connect back to the site at the URL `http://starlearningsystems.com/wp/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` via curl (or other fallback connection method built into WordPress) that it gets the error `cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 8000 milliseconds with 1 bytes received`. This means that WordPress' built-in simulated cron system cannot function properly, breaking some WordPress features & subsequently some plugins. There may be a problem with the server configuration (eg local DNS problems, mod_security, etc) preventing connections from working properly.
